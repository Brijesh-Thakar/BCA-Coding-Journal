# 📚 My BCA Coding Journey 🚀

Hey there! 👋  
Welcome to my **BCA (Bachelor of Computer Applications)** coding repository.  
This is where I upload all the codes and mini-projects I work on during my college journey – from Semester 1 to Semester 6. 🧑‍💻🎓

## 🧠 About This Repo

This repo is like my coding journal 📒 – organized semester-wise – containing:
- 🧾 Subject-wise code files and mini-projects
- 💻 Programs written during labs, assignments, and self-practice
- 🔄 Revisions, improvements, and personal notes

It's a mix of what I learn in college and what I explore on my own. Feel free to explore, learn, or suggest improvements! 😊
